                <p align="justify"><p style="font-size: 18pt; display: inline;">MediCom</p> is an innovative program which has all your health information at one click. This comprehensive website will track the <b>medications</b> you’ve taken and basic health information.</p>
                <p align="justify">Out of the many factors which can influence your health, medication adherence is one you can control. Medication adherence is defined as the extent to which a person takes medications as prescribed by their healthcare providers.</p>
                <p align="justify">The term Medication non-adherence is the lack of adherence to medication protocols. </p>
                <p align="justify">There are two important contributors to medication non-adherence: the patient-provider relationship and the following of medication protocols.</p>
                <p align="justify">Having an open and honest relationship with your health provider can improve your overall experience as a patient. Being able to talk openly about concerns and questions regarding medication can be helpful. A lot of people, however, do not have the opportunity to establish a meaningful relationship with their health care provider. </p>
                <p align="justify">Unfortunately, when it comes to following medication protocols, over 50% of patients either never fill their prescription, delay refills, discontinue or skip doses. This contributes to almost 70% of hospital admissions.</p>
                <p align="justify">Hence, MediCom is the key to making patients healthier and doctors happier.</p>
